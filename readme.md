## [virtual piano](https://dzmitry-duboyski-virtual-piano.netlify.app)

The [virtual piano](https://dzmitry-duboyski-virtual-piano.netlify.app) app, is an emulation of a piano, with the ability to change musical instruments. The application allows you to play the virtual piano using both the mouse and the keyboard.

# Application features:
- Play sounds on mouse or keyboard clicks.
- Ability to play sounds from different keys of the piano using the held down mouse button (the effect when you move your finger across the piano).
- Change the used musical instrument.
- Displays the currently pressed piano key.
- Change display mode: 'letters' - shows the used keyboard keys near the piano keys, 'notes' - shows the played notes near the piano keys.
- Implemented a full screen mode of the application.
